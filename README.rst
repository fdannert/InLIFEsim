InLIFEsim is a simulator built to analyze the impact of instrumental perturbations
on exoplanet detections and characterizations with nulling interferometers, particularly under the occurrence of
non-Gaussian noise. It extends the capabilities of `LIFEsim <https://github.com/fdannert/LIFEsim>`_.

Examples
-------------

The code needed to reproduce all figures and tables from `Dannert et al. 2025 <update link>`_ can be found in
`docs/source/paper_figures/`.
The data needed to create the figures is available on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/records/15260091>`_.
